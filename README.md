# GUIDE TO THE PERFECT APOLOGY

## 1. THIS IS NOT ABOUT YOU

the point of this is NOT to make yourself look good again.
it is to address what you did wrong, why it's wrong, and that you apologize to those you have hurt or wronged

EXAMPLE: You said something racist
```

	"I just wanna say im not racist/sexist/homophobic/etc" WRONG. there's a reason why u did/said what you did/said. DO NOT DEFEND YOURSELF. This is an apology, not a rebutle
	"I was just drunk at the time/going through some trauma/im neurodivergent" WRONG. There is no excuse for what you did or said. DO NOT DEFEND YOURSELF.
	"There is no excuse for what i did and im sorry" CORRECT! You DO NOT want to try to get people to think you're a good person. You want to admit and address what you did or said. whether or not you're good depends on the apologees
	""
```
	
	
## 2. FULL ACCOUNTABLILTY

remember you DID do something wrong and YOU DID affect people. Admit to it.
```
	"I apologize if i offended/hurt/affected anyone" WRONG. there is no "if". you DID.
	"I apologize for offending/hurting/affecting you" ALSO WRONG. you aren't in the wrong for making people upset. you're wrong for the action that you did
	"I'm sorry you feel hurt/offended for what i did/said" HELLA WRONG. This puts the accountablilty on the victim.
	"I apologize for [insert wrongdoing here]. I now know it [*reason why wrong doing is bad]." CORRECT. Not only did you awknowlege your action, you stated why what you did was wrong.
		*reason should never be "it offends/upsets people".
```
		* PROTIP: If you're apology answers the question "what did you do?" then it's a good start.
## 3. MAKE UP FOR IT (If possible)
	you cannot do this step until you have done the 1st two.
	For example, if you said something anti-black and have done the 1st steps, uplift some black voices, share some resources to help black people in need. even if it'll change your feed, do it! Show that you care.
	



## EXTRAS:
	- NEVER EXPECT FORGIVENESS (apologize anyway because you aren't looking for forgiveness remember ;P)
	- KEEP IT AS SERIOUS BUT GENUINE AS POSSIBLE (no joking talk. take this slash srs. don't talk like a resume tho. keep it slash gen)
	- DON'T USE TWITLONGER. USE TWITTER THREADS (ive seen better results from threads)
	- SPECIFY THAT THE NON-VICTIMS OF YOUR ACTIONS ARE NOT IN THE POSITION TO FORGIVE YOU 
    (white guy: sorry for n word
    other white guy: it's ok!
    white guy: you are not in the position to forgive me. you weren't affected
    	
    )
	
## CONCLUSION
If all this has been done and they still do not forgive you, let it go. You shouldn't spend time trying to convince someone. Just work at yourself and become better.
